# multirclonesetup
First and formost this based mainly on animosity22's work linked below. Im not going to cover the initial setup as its well documented below.
https://github.com/animosity22/homescripts

I wanted to move from a free account that I didnt have admin control over to the paid platform for Gdrive. The current minimum for users for
unlimited storage is 5 users. So I made 5 users and through some issues came up with the workflow shown in the code.

My setup is as follows

Main media server is local
Server that this is setup on is a VPS
The reason for this is to avoid bogging down local internet when items are uploading and downloading.
You can have your drives mounted in multiple locations as needed.
